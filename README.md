This is my realization of C library and some custom functions for manipulating with memory, strings, lists etc (more than 60 functions). 
Current version includes 2 another separate projects: C printf function realization https://github.com/ViktoriaLi/print_me 
and get_next_line https://github.com/ViktoriaLi/my_line function
for reading data from standart input or files and divide it by new line.
